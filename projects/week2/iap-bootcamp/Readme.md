## Deploying Zero Trust Identity Aware Proxy with Pomerium

In this project, I will be showing the how to with steps and demostration of deploying an identity aware proxy with Pomerium, which showcases layers of security that can be executed more effectively than a VPN, for instance.

## Setup

This can be easily achieved by signing up to the website `https://console.pomerium.app/` and importing the `compose.yaml` generated from the application. Then, we will start with the process.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```
